# Magician Webpage

I have built a website of a magician which consists of 2 pages - Home page and a sign up page. The First page contains multiple HTML5 tags
such as header, video, section, audio, footer, button, anchor, image tag, etc.
The user can click on the Sign Up button on the home page to go to the Sign Up page which consistes of a form. This page is for users to sign up and create 
their account by providing their First name, Last name, email and password. The project is built on HTML5 and CSS.
