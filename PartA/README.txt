# Cake Shop Webpage

For this part I have created a website for a cake shop having 2 web pages - home page with the menu and a feedback page with the form.
The home page has a menu which makes use of the Table html tag to implement and show the menu items of the cake shop in a table format.
This project is built on HTML5 and CSS using functionalities/controls such as div, heading, anchor tag, button, table, images, favicon, hyperlink, form, etc.

## The Code

#index.html

<link> tag is used for adding favicon.
<title> tag is used for adding the title to browser Tab
<h>,<p> tags are used for creating Heading and Paragraphs respectively.
<div> tag is used to divide sections in the webpage.  
<table> tag is used create a table.
<tr> tag is used to create a table row
<th> tag is used to create table Heading
<button> tag is used for adding button.
<a> is used to add link to a separate webpage for ordering custom cake and another one is used to move the user to the feedback page.

## Feedback.html
This is the next page of the coffee shop which contains a customer feedback form.

<form> tag is used to initialize a form.
<label> tag is used to create for each input text box.
<input> tag is used to take input from user for a particular label.
<select> tag is used to create a drop down list.
<option> tag is used to provide options in the drop down list for the select tag.

## CSS

#style.css
I have used a separate sttyle sheet named "style.css" which has all the styles applied to various classes associated to html tags and elements.
I have used tr:hover to make the row change color when hovered and changed the curson to pointer.
